undefined1. Code Folding: Implement code folding in the UI, allowing users to collapse and expand sections of code based on indentation or code blocks. This will make it easier for users to navigate and focus on specific parts of the code.

2. Syntax Highlighting: Add syntax highlighting for different programming languages to make the code more readable and visually appealing.

3. Autocomplete Suggestions: Implement an autocomplete feature that provides suggestions for variable names, function names, and other code elements as the user types. This can speed up the coding process and reduce errors.

4. Search and Filter: Add a search bar that allows users to search for specific keywords or phrases within the codebase. Additionally, implement filters to narrow down the search results based on criteria such as file type, date modified, or code complexity.

5. Side-by-side Comparison: Create a side-by-side comparison view that allows users to compare two different versions of the code or two different files. This can be helpful for understanding changes made during code reviews or debugging.

6. Code Snippets Library: Develop a library of reusable code snippets that users can easily insert into their code. This can save time and improve code consistency across the project.

7. Real-time Collaboration: Implement real-time collaboration features that allow multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously. This can improve teamwork and communication among developers.

8. Version Control Integration: Integrate the tool with popular version control systems like Git, allowing users to commit, push, and pull changes directly from the UI.

9. Customizable Themes: Provide a variety of customizable themes and color schemes for the UI, allowing users to personalize their coding environment according to their preferences.

10. Keyboard Shortcuts: Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions, such as saving, undoing, redoing, and navigating between files. This can help users work more efficiently and reduce reliance on the mouse.undefined
