"""
  1. Agent class: The base class for creating agents, which includes methods for handling user input, providing output, and managing tools.


2. Callback manager: A component that tracks agent actions and can be used to handle asynchronous calls.

3. LLMChain: A chain that takes in input and produces an action and action input, utilizing language models for prediction.

4. Asyncio: An asynchronous I/O framework that allows for running tasks concurrently and managing multiple threads.

5. Tool classes: A set of tools for specific tasks, such as JsonToolkit for JSON manipulation, NLAToolkit for natural language processing, OpenAPIToolkit for interacting with APIs, SQLDatabaseToolkit for SQL databases, and VectorStoreToolkit for vectorized data storage.

6. AgentExecutor: A class responsible for executing agent actions and managing their output.

7. Logging capabilities: Integrated logging features to track agent actions and output with different levels of severity.

To create a custom agent that combines these features, you would need to:

1. Define a new agent class that inherits from the base Agent class and implements the required methods.

2. Integrate the callback manager to handle asynchronous calls and track agent actions.

3. Utilize the LLMChain for action prediction and input processing.

4. Implement asyncio for concurrent task execution and multi-threading.

5. Incorporate the necessary tool classes for the tasks your agent needs to perform.

6. Use the AgentExecutor class to manage the execution of agent actions and their output.

7. Add logging capabilities to track agent actions and output with different levels of severity.

By combining these components, you can create a custom agent that provides access to stdout, concurrent processes, and multi-threading of tasks to achieve user goals.
